Use "" (2 double quotes) instead of ci' or ci".

You don't even have to be on the line you're interested in. The first screen line containing a pair of quotes will be used (a top screen line will be used if there are no quotes below the cursor).

In a line containing pairs of both type of quotes, the first quote left to the cursor will be used to decide.

You can repeat your action with '.', just install Tim Pope's repeat plugin.

Personalization: nmap "" <plug>QuotesCIQuotes
